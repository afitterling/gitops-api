# README

Specs and code for automated APIs

## about

We live in the 21st century and we all know kubernetes, docker, IaC.
We do not want to code anymore. We want to describe our programs. 

Redux defines itself as a pattern that can be interpreted as a result of a HoF of a complex UI state. Likewise any API....

Never be nerved with programmers....

The next step will be to teach a quantum computer to learn how to describe an app.
